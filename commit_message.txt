fix(test): upgrade to React 19 and resolve Vitest compatibility issues

Major upgrade to React 19 with extensive fixes for the testing environment.

**Dependencies:**
- Upgraded `react` and `react-dom` to v19.
- Upgraded `@testing-library/react` to v16+ (required for React 19).
- Upgraded `@testing-library/user-event` to v14+.

**Configuration (Vitest/Vite):**
- Fixed "Invalid hook call" / "Dispatcher null" errors caused by CJS/ESM split.
- Added `resolve.alias` with `path.resolve` to force a single React instance.
- Configured `test.server.deps.inline` to force React through the Vite pipeline.
- Set `resolve.conditions` to `['browser', 'development']` to avoid loading React Server Components in jsdom.

**Code Fixes:**
- DebugPanel: Fixed "Objects are not valid as a React child" by stringifying action objects.
- Tests: Refactored `DebugPanel.test.tsx` to use scoped `within()` queries for table cells, resolving ambiguous selector errors.
